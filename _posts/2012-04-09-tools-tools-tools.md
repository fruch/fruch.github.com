People always complain about tools, me included.
(a.k.a trying to show that their own tool set are better)
from text-editor to IDE, and don't get me starting on usability of some websites...

This guy took it a further and kind of made it into a life philosophy
[Bret Victor - Inventing on Principle][1]. and kinda of proved that all our tools suck.
Really liked the tools he demonstrated, especially the mario like demo.

BTW, his site is kinda of cool [http://worrydream.com/][2]
and I quote from there:
> "I designed the initial user interface concepts for iPad, iPod Nano, and half a 
> dozen  experimental  hardware  platforms.  Initiated,  designed,  and  prototyped  over 
> seventy concept projects..."

sound like a dream job.

and now it got me thinking, do I have a principle ? (or do I need one to get such a dream job ?)

probably not... or at least not yet... but I guess I'm getting there.

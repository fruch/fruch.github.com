Every time I need to start working on planning documentation, 
I get this weird feeling that I'm wasting my time.

I've tried to scribe down the reasons:
1. Nobody is going to read it, so why actully putting so much work into it ?
2. things are bound to change, so it isn't worth the paper it's written on (paper as in bytes on my hard-drive)
3. I know that I won't have time/manpower to actully do 20% of what I'm going to plan, so what the use ?
4. My English sucks, no one will understand what I'm writing
5. I never seen a good plan, that actully succeded. So there's no good plans...

Now I'm left with tackling each one, and trying to hack my brain into thinking it would be fun to write the plan...

Coming up next in "Fruch picking his brain"...

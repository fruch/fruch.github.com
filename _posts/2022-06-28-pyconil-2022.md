# Takes from pyconil 2022 

First in person conference I attend since Covid-19, was fun to meet some of the familiar faces
and meet a few new ones.
I've tried live tweeting, but seem like I'm not very good at it. (I'm better at hijacking others live tweets)

## Day 1

### Keynote
Keynote speaker couldn't make it, and was replaced by a panel of the known experts in python
While Sim Zacks asks them popular questions about python

[@alonisser] and I were a bit surprised, and [live tweeted](https://twitter.com/alonisser/status/1541672644273180672) the panel session:


### [Hidden cost of your favorite function](https://cfp.pycon.org.il/conference2022/talk/NZQNPP/)

[@mayaGBar] was talking about reason to profile,
and the importance of looking under the hood of the utilities and functions
we use and demonstrated using a profiler comparing different numpy function
to achieve the same goal.

### [Hidden Hacks in Linters for Better & More Secure Code](https://cfp.pycon.org.il/conference2022/talk/SGNBSX/)

[@gemanor] explained about a use case he and his team need to build lint checkers
for block different personas form doing things that shouldn't.

even that he introduce him self as non-pythonista ("alien" in his words), he managed
to showcase a high level python craftsmanship, and a fun talk overall. he's my MVP 
for this day

### [What happens when you import a module?](https://cfp.pycon.org.il/conference2022/talk/XNGJKS/)

[@reuvenmlerner] with very interesting talk about how exactly the import system works
while showing how to implement some parts of it.

while drinking the morning coffee, we had a talk with Reuven (me and someone I don't remember his name..)
about possible use-cases for using importlib.

one was for decryption of the sourcecode before executing it, to safeguard
the patented algorithms and company secrets.

and my use case of using it for testing script that were meant to be run as main module.
which is a nice way to avoid using subprocess, so mocks can be used:

### [Off road profiling - when the automated profilers just don't cut it.](https://cfp.pycon.org.il/conference2022/talk/YJGQNC/)

[@ShacharSh] goes over how to manually profile some bits of code, and how the
project he built `manprof` can help with that.

that was last talk for the day, and I've could really concentrate on tweeting about it,
but it was very nice to see Shachar talk, and improvise punchlines at the right time
like when someone's phone rang during his talk.
 
It was a shame that his package isn't yet public (said something about legal didn't yet improve, which always makes me
a bit sad, that those processes are never straight forward)

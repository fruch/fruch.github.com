So I've started a blog. 

First thanks, to [JekyllBootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) for the code, 
and for [Github](http://github.com/) for the hosting (כבודה של אכסניה)

Even that I uselly don't use ruby, I've installed it on my win7 for running jekyll.
thanks god no need to actully code in ruby for that.

I hope now I can actully share some of my insights about python and life in general.
(after I fooled around a whole day on choosing the theme, and adding facebook comments)

I wish myself that I'll find time to write.

Fruch out...

## Intro ##
All the nice python package I used/seen, and I need a place to write 
them down, so I won't forget them.
(one day I'll sort them, and maybe arrange it to something more.. somthing...)

## The Ammo Create ##
### Un-catgorized (yet) ###
- [pbs](https://github.com/amoffat/pbs) (might be called sh in the near future)
- [RPyC](https://github.com/tomerfiliba/rpyc) - 
- [Commando](https://github.com/lakshmivyas/commando) - It's actully from the same guy that made hyde (which is kind of python clone of jekyll)

### Web ###
- Django - actully the realted packages to django is quite huge...

### Handling binray data ###
- [bitstring](http://code.google.com/p/python-bitstring/)
